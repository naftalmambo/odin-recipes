  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
<li>
    <h3><strong>Butter</strong></h3>
    <p> This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3><strong>Vanilla</strong></h3>
    <p>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3><strong>Baking Soda</strong></h3>
<p>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3><strong>Flour</strong></h3>
    <p>All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong></h3>
    <p>Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3><strong>Water</strong></h3>
    <p> A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</p>
</li>
